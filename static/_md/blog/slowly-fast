# slowly fast

July 2023

Over the past 3-ish years, I have embraced the notion that execution is everything. The idea that you should “move fast and break things” matters greatly. These ideas are also prevalent in the hustle culture. While the process has been fruitful in objective ways, it has led me to feeling burnt out.

Hmm, okay. Maybe this is not the best approach. So, do I not work hard? Do I not pull the all nighters for the ideas I truly believe in? Does execution not matter so much? That’s wrong too. I still need to move fast. But the execution has to be sustainable. For meaningful outcomes, some decluttering is needed.

### focus

Information is abundant. Awareness for an average Indian with an internet communications device in the pocket is a solved problem. It really just comes down to having bias for action. In pursuit of action, it is tempting to initiate in many possible directions. Anecdotally, I see more people starting things than people finishing things. This mostly makes sense. The delta can't be negative. It can at best, be zero. But the problem is, the delta only seems to increase with time. In times of abundance, being someone who "acts" and "finishes" is a hard thing. There are too many distractions out there. The worst ones are of the kind that put you into a delusion that you are doing great work but actually, you are probably just grinding in the wrong direction. In an age of abundance, it is hard to focus. 

### slow

Before diving headlong into that alluring, shiny new venture, take a moment to pause and reflect. Ask yourself sincerely, "Is this <insert shiny new thing> truly worth your precious efforts, or should you be directing your energy towards something you genuinely believe in?" Decluttering your mind and intentions might be the key to finding the right path.
In a world where the pace seems relentless, it's essential to slow down and engage in thoughtful contemplation before leaping into action. Consider whether the path you're about to embark upon aligns with your long-term goals and aspirations. Will it genuinely expedite your journey towards success, or could it be steering you off course? This introspection is crucial because if your actions aren't contributing to your progress, you are probably doing it wrong. I write this part in third person since I find this to be widely applicable. 

Meaningful outcomes are a function of time, hard work and luck. Time is a precious resource. Luck keeps varying. Both, however, can be optimised by focus. To focus, we need to slow down, fuck around and find out what truly matters. And then go all in.
