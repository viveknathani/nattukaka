# the resentment

Welcome to the third installment of “/special”. This is about the anger I am experiencing towards the breakup and her. 

I am mad, just absolutely mad at her. I do not hate her but I hate what she did. I don’t want to be missing her. After all that we were working towards, she chose to discredit everything and walk away. That felt so inconsiderate. That felt selfish. If you love somebody, you fight for that love. It hurts so much. I hate that she didn’t believe in us enough. I feel like my commitment has not been valued or respected enough. It is just so fucking hard to deal with this pain. It affects me so much because I did not expect her to hurt me like this.

This is my second post of the day. I want to get it all out of my chest. I want to lay it all out. There are so so so many feelings.  I want the best for her but I am mad at her. I want to let her go but I am mad at her. I want her to be happy but I am mad at her. I respect her but I am mad at her. I love her but she did the wrong thing to me. I am mad at her for leaving me like this.
