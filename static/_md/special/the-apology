the apology

Varda, I am sorry. I am sorry that my ambitions came at the cost of your happiness. While I wanted you to stay, I do know that I was wrong in hurting you. I should have balanced us and work. Each chance in life is too expensive to be taken for granted and I regret doing that. Nothing will ever make what I did less wrong.
