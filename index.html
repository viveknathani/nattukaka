    <h2>nattukaka</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to nattukaka - my longest running software project with a silly
      name. It is named after a famous character in an Indian TV show called
      taarak mehta ka ooltah chashmah, who with his nephew, can get anything
      done for his employer. It sounds like a cool name for a do-it-all-for-me
      server!
    </p>
    <h3>early days</h3>
    <p>
      It started out as a simple bot that sends me the top 10 Hacker News
      stories everyday at 7.00AM IST. I have written enough complex programs for
      a living but I think this simple bot is the coolest of all the code I have
      ever written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next few months, I thought of taking nattukaka and turning it
      into a “i will do anything” tool. I made a notes app into this. I made a
      todo app (we have all been there). I killed most of these projects after
      few weeks of operation - because I was not using them. The HN bot was
      still the most used program.
    </p>
    <h3>infrastructure is everything</h3>
    <p>
      When I set out to build
      <a href="https://teachyourselfmath.app">teachyourselfmath</a>, I figured
      that the web server hosting space is insanely pricey for hackers like me
      who just want to run web servers for fun. With a database here and there
      if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I keep getting these small scale ideas that are fun to build and be
      consumed by the internet. I am not building the next Facebook here. I am
      just having fun. I figured I don’t need the reliability offerings these
      external services provide. I could just run my small scale services on my
      own VPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brings me to what nattukaka is today. It is a single VPS that runs my
      entire software stack.
    </p>
    <h3>architecture</h3>
    <p>
      Every web service runs as a Docker container and has a deployment script
      in the
      <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/nattukaka/master/apps/"
        >apps directory</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The VPS also runs a PostgreSQL database and a Redis instance - but they
      are not directly exposed to the internet. I can access them from anywhere
      via <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>opening the gates</h3>

    <p>
      When I was just starting out in my journey of programming - I had little
      money to pay for cloud. It was really hard to figure out free hosting
      solutions as an early college kid. While I can’t solve everybody’s
      problems right now - I think I can help my friends and family out. If you
      are someone who is close to me and wants to run a small scale project on
      the internet, I’d be happy to host it for you, for free. You bring your
      code. I run it for you.
    </p>
    <h3>closing thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      It has taken 2 years of fuck-around-and-find-out to arrive at nattukaka’s
      current form. And I have had a lot of fun putting this all together. If
      you also have small scale software projects of your own, you should
      consider hosting them on your own too.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you'd like to run this by yourself, here's the
      <a href="https://github.com/viveknathani/nattukaka">github link</a> for
      this project.
    </p>
    <p>Happy hacking!</p>
